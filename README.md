# Hotlink-Watermark

Tired of having you images "hotlinked" by a competitor?

Want to play them a little trick while they steal your hard-work and your bandwidth?

Here a simple piece of code you can use to add a watermark to your images when they are requested from outside your
domain.


## Installation

1. Place the `hotlink.php` file in your web root and edit the few configs at the top of the file.

2. Replace the `watermark.gif` image by your logo, or anything funny really. You can use a png or jpeg too.

3. Edit the `.htaccess` file – your can merge with yours – to suit your needs.


## Credits

Most of the image manipulation code is from Matt Wilcox's [Adaptive-Image](https://github.com/MattWilcox/Adaptive-Images)
and repurposed for watermarking.
